Platformer Game
======

This is a platformer type game
built in python and pygame.

# How to:

You need to have python 3 in order to run this.
(Actually, you don't. It works with 2.7.10, but
I'm using py3.)

You also need pygame. Here is how you can add
pygame to your python 3 installation.

And you can get the .whl file here:

If you are using 3.4, you grab the cp34 wheel file.
If you are using 3.4, you grab the cp35 wheel file.
Etc.

I recommend using python 3.5 with pygame cp35.
